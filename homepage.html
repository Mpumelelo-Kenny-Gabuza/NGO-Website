                <p class="survivor_quote">"Finding strength in community and hope in healing - my journey with Manyana
                    Mhlali Development transformed my life."</p>
                <p class="survivor_paragraph">My name is Thandi. For a long time, I lived in a silence that was louder than any noise. After losing my job, the weight of providing for my two children felt unbearable. The stress and hopelessness were a constant cloud over me. I felt like I was failing as a mother, and the loneliness was crushing. I didn't know it then, but I was struggling with my mental health, and I had no one to talk to.

At my lowest point, I heard a community health worker from Manyana Mhlali Development speaking at a local shop. She was talking about mental health, saying it was okay not to be okay, and that asking for help was a sign of strength. Those words planted a small seed of hope in me.

I found the courage to attend one of MMD's support groups. Walking through that door was the hardest step I have ever taken, but it was also the first step on my new path. I was met not with judgment, but with understanding. For the first time, I shared my story and my fears. I learned that I was not alone.

<!-- Through MMD's Mental Health Programme, I learned coping mechanisms for my anxiety and stress. The facilitators helped me see my own strength again. As I grew stronger, I knew I needed to become financially independent to secure a better future for my children. -->

<!-- That's when I joined MMD's Sustainable Livelihoods Programme. I received training in sewing and small business management. With a small seed grant and ongoing mentorship, I started my own business mending and making school uniforms. My small home-based business is now growing, and I can provide for my family with dignity.

My son also benefited from MMD's work, safely participating in the Male Circumcision Programme, which gave me peace of mind as a mother.

MMD didn't just give me a handout; they gave me a hand up. They helped me heal my mind and build a future with my own hands. The community I found with the other women in the programmes became my new "village," the one that helped me raise my children and rediscover myself.

My message to anyone who is suffering in silence is this: You are not alone. Your story is not over. There is help, there is hope, and there is a path forward. Let Manyana Mhlali Development walk with you on that path.!</p> -->
